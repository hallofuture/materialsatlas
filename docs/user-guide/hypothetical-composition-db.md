# Hypothetical Materiasl Composition Database

## Manual

### Background

This database includes the hypothetical materials compositions/formulas generated by our recent Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) based materials recipe generator (MATGAN) published on Nature npj Computational Materials in 2020 [^1].  The problem of generating new materials compositions is how to create candidates that satisfy all the basic chemical rules and are synthesizable to generate stable crystal structures. Rational design of new compositions based on several known chemical rules is not easy despite some local tinkering such as dopoing or element substitution is possible. Here we develop the MATGAN algorithm based on the GAN deep neural network model, which can learn implicit chemical rules embodied as the generator neural network model and use them to generate chemical valid candidate materials compositions. The formulas generated tend to observe the well-known chemical rules such as balanced charge and electronegativity and have valid oxidation states. 

### The Generation of New Materials Recipes/Compositions Method

The generator is based on the GAN neural network model as described in our npj paper [^1]. The GAN model is composed of a generator neural network and a discriminator neural network. When trained with the known materials formulas in the Materials Project database, the generator is trained to generate samples as similar as possible to the known  materials, at the same time, the discriminator is trained to differentiate the true formulas and generated fakes. The armed-race of these two processes push the generator to learn complex chemical rules for assembling chemically valid materials compositions.

### The compound generation procedure

Our generative adversal network (GAN) model for inorganic materials composition generation is trained with the formulas of known materials as deposited in Materials Project, ICSD or OQMD databases. Once it is trained, a simple run can generate new composition.

### Searching the hypothetical materials database

#### Entering Inputs

Practically, the procedure for getting predictions consists in 3 steps

1. Pick elements: Select on the periodic table what constituent elements comprise the chemical space you are interested in.
   For instance if you want to make predictions for battery materials based on Li, Mn and O, you should pick those three elements. 
You can also directly type the element symbols separated by space. 

2. Click "Check Now" button

3. The system will show a list of compatible formulas organized in pages of tables. 

4. You can further narrow down the search by typing more precise pattern of the formula. e.g.  Li2Mn

#### Interpreting the Results

The materials compositions have only been checked with basic chemical rules. Formation energy and synthesizability have not been evaluated. So it maybe desirable to use composition based formation energy prediction app to check it. After that, one can also try to estimate the e-above-hull energy to check its synthesizability.

### Future features

To add more information to the hypothetical materials compositions, machine learning models of materials properties will be applied to the data entries to calculate their computed physical and chemical properties.
