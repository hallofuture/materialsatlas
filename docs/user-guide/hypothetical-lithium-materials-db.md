# Hypothetical Lithium Compound/Materials Structure Database


#### by Dr. Jianjun Hu

## Manual

### Background 
Lithium compound materials is playing critical role in portable batteries and electric vehicles. This database aims to collect hypothetical crystal materials structures from several generative models of crystal structures.


### The Database Generation Method

We use both crystal structure generator algorithms such as CubicGAN [^1] or physics guided generator [^2], or composition generator such as MATGAN [^3] plus crystal structure prediction algorithms to generate new crystal mateials candidates and then just add those lithium compounds to this database.


### Performance and Limitations


Please note that the compositions in this databse is hypothetical and have no guarantee for its synthesizability or structural stablity. 

### Using the Database Search function

#### Entering Inputs

Practically, the procedure for getting predictions consists in 3 steps

1. Pick elements: Select on the periodic table what constituent elements comprise the chemical space you are interested in.
   For instance if you want to make predictions for battery materials based on Li, Mn and O, you should pick those three elements.
2. After the results are returned, you can further narrow down the search by typing in the top right input box with more specific partial formula, e.g. Li2
3. Interpret the results.
   

#### Interpreting the Results

The results pages provides a set of potential Lithium compound materials. 



### Future features

In the future, we want to generate more Lithium materials candidates.
