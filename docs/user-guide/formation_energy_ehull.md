### Background

The formation energy of a material defines the energy required to dissociate that material into its respective elements. Thus, it indicates the thermodynamic stability against the elements used to form the material. Usually, the density functional theory (DFT) based first-principles calculations are performed to calculate the formation energy. For that purpose, it is required to identify the crystal structure data in advance. However, the ground state structures are unknown for most of the compositions. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the formation energy of a new composition using DFT. Another disadvantage of the above method is that the first-principles calculation of formation energy is time-consuming and expensive.
