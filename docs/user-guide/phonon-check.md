# Phonon Dispersion Prediction

## Manual

### Background
Phonons are massless quantum mechanical particles that are formed due to atomic vibrations within the crystal lattice. The importance of studying phonons is a significant number of physical properties, such as Raman scattering spectra, thermal expansion, and heat conduction can be explained using phonons [^1]. The phonon dispersion is the relationship between the k-space and the frequencies of normal modes for all the optical and acoustic branches of lattice vibrations in a selected direction in the crystal. The number of branches is equal to the number of degrees of freedom of the unit cell [^2]. Computational prediction of phonon dispersion patterns can help to evaluate the dynamic stability of a hypothetical material structure. Generally, the stability of a material in terms of the lattice dynamics is examined by verifying whether all the normal vibrational modes have a real and finite frequency within the first Brillouin zone [^3]. 

### Prediction method

Recently, we have developed a graph neural network based phonon Density of States(DOS) prediction algorithm using our recent scalalbe DeeperGATGNN algorithm.
