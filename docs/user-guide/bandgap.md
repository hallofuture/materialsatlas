# Band Gap Predictor


## Manual

### Background

The band gap is the energy difference between the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) in the electronic band structure of a material. The band gaps of the semiconductors are greater than the bandgap of metals (0 eV) and smaller than that of insulators (usually greater than 4 eV)[^1]. The band gap acts as a forbidden gap for electrons, which can not shift from VBM to CBM without enough external energy. The valence region electrons do not contribute to electric current, while the electrons in conduction bands are free to move.   Therefore, by modulating the external thermal energy, we can tune the electron flow of a semiconductor [^2]. The semiconductors with band gaps larger than 2 eV are known as wide band gap semiconductors. Those are much useful for producing devisors operated at high temperatures and frequencies [^3]. Computational prediction of band gaps allow fast screening of millions of hypothetical compositions generated by modern generative design models such as MATGAN [^5]. 




### The Bandgap Prediction methods

We developed two prediction models for band gap prediction using the known materials with bandgap information in the MaterialsProject database. 

#### The composition based Bandgap prediction model

Our composition model is trained using the Magpie descriptors from the Matminer package [^4] together with the Roost neural network model [^5]. 
For this model, only the formula or composition is needed. 

#### The deep graph neural network model for Bandgap prediction

Our structure based bandgap prediction model is based on our latest work of DeeperGATGNN algorithm [^6], which is a scalable deep graph neural network model with the state-of-the-art performance for structure based materials property prediction. 

### Performance and Limitations

### Using the Bandgap Predictor

#### Entering Inputs

Practically, the procedure for getting predictions consists in 3 steps

1. Input a material formula or a csv with a list of formulas. It will automatically use the composition machine learning model. You can also upload a structure cif file, it will select the graph neural network model accordingly. 

2. click "predict now"

3. collect the result or download the results csv file.

### Future features

In the future, we want to further improve the performance of our model using transfer learning and semi-supervised learning.
