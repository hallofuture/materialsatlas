### Background on 2D materials Prediction

Two dimensional materials such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride have the potential to create new electronics
and technologies such as spintronics, catalysis, and membranes owing to their exotic vibrational, electronic, optical magnetic, and topological behaviors. 2D compounds need to have requisite geometric and bonding criteria to make them relatively easy to exfoliate so that they can have potentially interesting physical and electromagnetic properties. Here we develop a composition based machine learning screening model [^1] to filter out potential 2D materials from millions of hypothetical materials compositions generated by our MATGAN algorithm [^2]. 


### The 2D materials classification model:

We employ the Random Forest (RF)  as the surrogate model for predicting the 2D probability given a
materialâ€™ Magpie composition features [^3]. Magpie feature set is calculated using the matminer library which
is a Python-based platform that facilitates data-driven methods for analyzing and predicting material properties by
calculating a variety of descriptors from material compositions or crystal structures. Magpie feature set summarizes 132
features about material composition information, such as atomic number in the material, range of melting temperature,
mean absolute deviation of valence. Those 132 features of each material will be calculated and used in our random
forest model training.

### Using the 2D material Predictor

#### Entering Inputs

Practically, the procedure for getting predictions consists in 4 steps

1. Provide a csv file of formulas or provide 1 or more material formulas separated by comma or space (no processing if file uploaded)
2. Click "Check Now"
3. Check if a crystal material with a given formula is a 2D or layered material and print the 2D materials formulas
4. Download detailed results by clicking link

#### Interpreting the Results
The result contains formula, label and probability
