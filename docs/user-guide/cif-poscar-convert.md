## Manual

### Background

This is a simple utility to convert the crystal structure file formats between cif and poscar, which is used in DFT simulation.

### Using the Converter

#### Steps

Practically, the procedure consists in 4 steps

1. Choose conversion direction: Cif to Poscar or Poscar to Cif
2. Upload a Cif or Poscar file and input email for notification 
3. Click "Convert Now" button
4. Download the result file when conversion is done
