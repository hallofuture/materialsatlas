# Ionic Conductivity Predictor



## Manual

### Background 

Ionic conducctivity prediction has big potential in computational design for battery materials, which is, however, an extremely challenging problem due to the lack of sufficient ion conductivity datas and the complex relationships from structure to this property. There are a few attempts for this problem. The most notable one is [^7], in which the authors first search for
materials satisfying several prerequisite requirements (i.e. other than ionic conductivity), and then utilize 40 experimental data samples to build a fast ionic conductivity classification model using 20 hand-crafted physical/structural descriptors (See below) and logistic regression classifer to look for the most likely superionic materials among these remaining candidates. Then used it for screening 12 000 candidates and billions of compositions [^8]. Another XGBoost model is develped in [^6] for ion conductivity prediction of perovskites. Trained with 7000 samples and a set of features including average ionic radius, minimum electronegativity, minimum atomic mass, minimum formation energy of oxides for all B-site, and B-site dopant ions of the perovskite as the crucial and relevant predictors for determining conductivity and the type of charge carriers. In [^3], Using primarily theoretical elemental feature descriptors derivable from tabulated information on the unit cell and the atomic properties of the components of a target compound on a limited dataset of 70 NASICON-examples, the authors  designed a logistic regression-based model capable of distinguishing between poor and good superionic conductors with a cross-validation accuracy of over 82%. Here the extremely limited ion conductivity data limits the application of powerful complex models such as graph neural networks.

### The Ionic conductivity Prediction Method

In this app, we plan to implement two models including the the XGboost model for perovskite ion conductivity prediction and the logistic regression model for ionic conductivity of sodium and lithium-based SICON compounds. 

We will also implement a composition based ion conductivity predictor using the Roost model. 

### The ionic conductivity prediction procedure

The process includes 2 stages, including feature extraction from structures and machine learning prediction. 

### Performance and Limitations

Due to the extremely small dataset, the prediction performance may only be good for the specific subset of materials such as perovskites. The models trained with 70 or 40 samples cannot generalize well out of their training domain. 

### Using the Predictor

#### Entering Inputs

Practically, the procedure for getting predictions consists in 3 steps

1. Upload a cif structure file or a csv file or just input some formulas in the input text box.

2. Start the prediction: click 'Predict Now' to begin the prediction.
   
4. Examine results: Upon completion of the task, you will be given a link to download the results. 


#### Interpreting the Results

The users need to be cautious over the predicted results due to the uncertainy with the models trained with small dataset. 


### Future features

Due to the limited labelled data of ion conductivity, we will apply transfer learning and semi-supervised learning to improve our model performance.
