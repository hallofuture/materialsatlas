## Introduction[^1]

Piezoelectricity is a reversible physical process that occurs in some
materials whereby an electric moment is generated upon the application
of a stress. This is often referred to as the direct piezoelectric
effect. Conversely, the indirect piezoelectric effect refers to the case
when a strain is generated in a material upon the application of an
electric field. The mathematical description of piezoelectricity relates
the strain (or stress) to the electric field via a third order tensor.
This tensor describes the response of any piezoelectric bulk material,
when subjected to an electric field or a mechanical load.

The piezoelectric constants from the Materials Project (MP) are
calculated from first principles Density Functional Perturbation Theory
(DFPT) [^1] and are approximated as the superimposed effect of an
electronic and ionic contribution. From the full piezoelectric tensor,
several properties are derived such as the maximum longitudinal
piezoelectric modulus and the corresponding crystallographic direction.
Just as with the elastic constants, multiple consistency checks are
performed on all the calculated piezoelectric data to ensure its
reliability and accuracy.
