# Phonons

## Introduction [^1]

A phonon is a collective excitation of a set of atoms in condensed
matter.
These excitations can be decomposed into different modes, each
being associated with an energy that corresponds to the frequency of the
vibration.
The different energies associated with each vibrational mode
constitute the phonon vibrational spectra (or phonon band structure).
The vibrational spectra of materials play an important role in physical
phenomena such as thermal conductivity, superconductivity,
ferroelectricity and carrier thermalization.
